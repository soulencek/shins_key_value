A simple key-value store that uses Redis for storage and supports optional encryption and compression of stored values.

Dependencies:
- Redis
- Dotenv
- Zlib

Functions:

- `get(key: string): Promise<any>`
  - Retrieves the value for the given key from the store.
  - Returns a promise that resolves with the value. If the key does not exist, the promise resolves with null.

- `set(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>`
  - Stores the given value in the store under the given key.
  - Returns a promise that resolves when the value has been stored.

- `watcher(key: string, log_time: boolean, callback: (value: any) => void, saved_update_time?: string): void`
  - Monitors the given key for updates and executes the given callback function when the key is updated.
  - If `log_time` is true, the update time for the key will be logged to the console when the key is updated.
  - The `saved_update_time` argument is optional and should only be provided if you want to initialize the saved update time with a specific value.


Exported objects:
- `client: RedisClient`
  - The Redis client instance used by the key-value store.
